<h3><b>AGREEMENT BETWEEN USER AND VARUS  </b></h3><br>
<span><!-- line here --></span>
<h4 align="left">
1. General:</h4>

 

<p align="left">Welcome to the VARUS.com website (the "Website"). The terms "we", "us", "our" and “VARUS” refer to VARUS  having its offices at Kesselstraße 5-7, 40221 Düsseldorf, Germany, a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and registered with the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under registration number 67222927. Access to our Website, any Varus mobile or tablet application, or any other feature or other Varus platform (collectively the "Platform") is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms"). We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for future reference. Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of our Platform and sets out the terms on which we may process any personal information that we collect about you, or that you provide to us, and is incorporated by reference into these Terms. The Privacy Policy can be found here. By accessing or using our Platform, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access our Platform or contact our support center here. 

 

<h4>2. Changes to the Terms </h4>

 

<p>We may amend these Terms from time to time to comply with any regulatory requirements or if there are changes to our business practices. Every time you wish to use our Platform, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the terms that apply at the time. Your use of our Platform will be subject to the most recent version of the Terms available on the Platform. We recommend that you read through the Terms available on the Platform regularly so that you can be sure that you are aware of any changes that may apply to you.</p> 

 

<h4>3. Access and Use of the Platform</h4> 

 

<p>The Platform is currently made available to you for your personal, non-commercial use, free of charge. 

 

We do not guarantee that access to the Platform, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of the Platform without notice to you. 

 

You must not misuse the Platform by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or any other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Platform, the server on which the Platform is stored or any server, computer or database connected to the Platform. You must not attack the Platform via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use the Platform will cease immediately. 
</p>
<h4>4. We do not sell Hotel Products or other Travel Products</h4> 

 

<p>The Platform is a hotel search engine that provides users with comparisons for different offers for hotel rooms. Varus does not provide, own or control any of the hotel services and products that you can access through our Platform (the “Hotel Products”). The Hotel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Hotel Providers”), either directly (e.g., a hotel) or through a facilitator of hotel reservations (e.g., an online travel company). The Hotel Providers are responsible for the Hotel Products and for all booking contracts, including for example Varus Express Bookings. The booking of a Hotel Product will solely be made with the Hotel Provider. The Hotel Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to, and understand those terms. Further, the terms of the hotel where you plan to stay, if different from the Hotel Provider, will also apply to your booking, so you must also agree to, and understand those terms. Your interaction with any Hotel Provider accessed through our Platform is at your own risk, and Varus does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking. Varus has no control over the Hotel Products or Hotel Providers. For more information about how Varus works, we recommend that you read our FAQs, which can be found here and are incorporated by reference into these Terms. </p>

 

<p>Varus may also display offers for travel destination products such as, e.g., tours, events, attractions, cruises and others. Varus does not provide, own or control any of the destination travel products that you can access through our Platform (the “Travel Products”). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the “Travel Product Provider”), either directly (e.g., a tour operator) or through a facilitator (e.g., an online travel company). The Travel Product Providers are responsible for the Travel Products and all booking contracts. The Travel Product Provider’s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to, and understand those terms. Further, the terms of the individual operator of the Travel Product which you plan to use, if different from the Travel Product Provider, will also apply to your booking, so you must also agree to, and understand those terms. </p>

 

<p>Your interaction with any Hotel Provider or Travel Product Provider accessed through our Platform is at your own risk, and Varus does not have any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking. Varus has no control over the Hotel Products and Travel Products (together “the Products”) or Hotel Providers and Travel Product Providers (together “the Providers”). For more information about how Varus works, we recommend that you read our FAQs, which can be found here and are incorporated by reference into these Terms. </p>

 

<p>Varus hosts content, including prices, images and other information, made available by or obtained from Providers (“Provider Content”), as well as content provided by users, such as comments, ratings and other information (“User Content” and together with the Provider Content, the “Content”). Varus is in no way responsible or liable for the accuracy, quality, completeness, reliability, timeliness or trustworthiness of the Content, and Varus has no influence over the Content. In particular, we do not guarantee that Provider Content, in particular the prices reflected therein, will be updated in real time or that a particular Product will be available. As a result, the price displayed by a Provider may not correspond to that displayed on our Platform.Ratings displayed on this Platform are intended as only general guidelines, and we do not guarantee the accuracy of the ratings or of any User Content. </p>

 

<h4>5. Varus Express Booking and Varus Book & Go </h4>

 

<p>The “Varus Express Booking” and Varus Book & Go services facilitate the booking of a Hotel Product with a Hotel Provider through our Platform. We may make Varus Express Booking and/or Varus Book & Go available in our discretion from time to time. If you opt to use Varus Express Booking or Varus Book & Go (where available), the booking will be made with the Hotel Provider named on the booking page respectively the checkout page, and Varus will forward the booking information that you provide to the relevant Hotel Provider. When you make a booking through Varus Express Booking or Varus Book & Go, our Platform acts as only a user interface, and you will only have a valid booking with a Hotel Provider if you receive written confirmation within two days from that Hotel Provider accepting your booking. The contract for the relevant booking will be made between you and the Hotel Provider. Varus will indicate the Hotel Provider, who is the actual merchant of record, e.g. on the checkout page, the booking website or in the terms and conditions for the booking. Varus has no responsibility for the booking or the Hotel Product because Varus neither creates the description of the Hotel Product, defines the price and any fees, confirms any booking nor provides the Hotel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes around your booking and/or the Hotel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Hotel Provider . </p>

</p>

 

<h4>13. Our liability is limited </h4>

 

<p>Varus makes no representations about the suitability of the Content displayed on our Platform for any purpose. The display on our Platform of a Product or any Content does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by Varus of that Product or that Content, or any sponsorship or approval of such Product or such Content by such Provider, or any affiliation between such Provider and Varus. All Content and any other information provided on our Platform are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. Varus disclaims all warranties and conditions that this Platform, its servers or any email sent from Varus are free of viruses or other harmful components. Varus hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with regard to any Content or any other information provided on our Platform, including all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular response, title and non-infringement. 

 

The Providers are independent from Varus and are not agents or employees of Varus. Varus is not liable for the acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any Provider, including for injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom. Varus will not be liable for any cancellation, overbooking, strike, force majeure or other causes beyond its direct control. Varus does not accept responsibility for the uninterrupted accessibility to our Platform and may carry out technical or maintenance work on the Platform at any of its choosing. 

 

In no event shall Varus be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected with, your access to, display of or use of this Platform or with the delay or inability to access, display or use this Platform (including, but not limited to, your reliance upon opinions appearing on this Platform; any computer viruses, information, software, linked sites, products and services obtaining through this Platform; or otherwise arising out of the access to, display of or use of this Platform) whether based on a theory of negligence, contract, tort, strict liability, consumer protection statutes, or otherwise, and even if Varus has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

 

If, despite the limitation above, Varus is found liable for any loss or damage which arises out of, or in any way connected with, any of the occurrences described above, then the liability of Varus will in no event exceed, in the aggregate, One-Hundred Dollars (US{100}.00) or the equivalent in local currency. 

 

The limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these Terms survive the termination of your relationship with Varus. 
</p>

 

<h4>14. You agree to protect us</h4> 

 

<p>You agree to defend and indemnify Varus and any of its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other costs or expenses of any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought by third parties as a result of: 

 

your breach of these Terms or the documents referenced herein; 

 

your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or 

 

your use of our Platform. 
</p>

 

<h4>15. Dispute Resolution </h4>

 

<p>Varus is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section. 

 

You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Platform, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Varus’s customer support center here. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below. 

 

Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us and our subsidiaries. This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms required arbitration. 

 

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. 

 

Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and specifically Consumer Arbitration Rule R-14, which gives the arbitrator the power to rule on all issues concerning the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than {10},000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location. 

 

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Varus Legal,” at Varus  Kesselstraße 5-7, 40221 Düsseldorf, Germany. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. 

 

Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction. 
</p>

 

<h4>16. Complaints or Queries </h4>

 

<p>If you have any queries or complaints about the Platform, please contact our support center here. We will use reasonable efforts to respond to you promptly. 
</p>

 

<h4>17. General </h4>

 

<p>These Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and for searches or bookings made by U.S. residents, the laws of the state in which you reside, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Use of our Platform is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this paragraph. 

 

Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of our Platform or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. 

 

These Terms do not create or infer any rights that are enforceable by any person who is not a party to them. 

 

If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired. Our failure or delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms at any time does not waive our right to enforce the same or any other provision(s) hereof in the future. 

 

Fictitious names of companies, products, people, characters, and/or data mentioned on the Platform are not intended to represent any real individual, company, product, or event. 

 

Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
